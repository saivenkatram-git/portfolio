		Hey 👋, i’m a full-stack developer from Mumbai who can’t leave a
		<span class="text-purple-:00"><b><i>“how does this work?”</i></b></span>
		question unanswered. Half the things I’ve built started because I got curious, opened a blank file,
		and somehow ended up shipping something that <b><i>(miraculously)</i></b> works. I love the thrill
		of breaking, fixing, and over-engineering things until they behave. When I’m not debugging at 3 am,
		i’m playing Valorant, recording music covers, or contemplating my next useless tech investment. My
		code runs on curiosity, caffeine, and the occasional panic when something finally deploys correctly.
